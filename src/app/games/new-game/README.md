To create a new game named `foo`:
  - Create the directory `src/app/games/foo/`
  - Copy the files from this directory into `src/app/games/foo/`, renaming them accordingly. For example, `NewGameMove.ts` becomes `FooMove.ts`.
  - Rename the classes accordingly.


Recommended order to define your game:
  - Move
